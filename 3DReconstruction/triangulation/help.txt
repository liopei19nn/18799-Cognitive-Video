1.Get point cloud without background and RGB, use 
singlFaceColor.m generate triangulation.

2.Get point cloud with background and RGB, use
extractfromBG.m to get point cloud

3.Get point cloud without background, but with RGB,
use TriangleRGBwithDepth.m to get triangulation

4.Get point cloud without background, but with GDB,
TriangleRGBwithDepthCrust.m to get MyCrust Triangulation

5.Get 3D point set with (X,Y,Z), use myRobustcrust.m to 
get triangulation with MyCrust method.
